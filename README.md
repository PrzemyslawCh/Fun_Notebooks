# Fun Notebooks Repository
Welcome to the Fun Notebooks Repository! This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that are more about having fun and exploring different ideas than practical application. They are meant to inspire curiosity and demonstrate the wide range of things you can do with Python and data.

## Repository Structure
Each notebook is contained in its own folder, which includes the notebook file itself (.ipynb), any necessary data files, and a README file that explains what the notebook does, how to run it, and any interesting findings or if it small project it is just notebook.

## Notebooks
### Random Google Maps Place
#### File: Random_place_from_google_maps.ipynb

This notebook uses the Google Maps API to select a random place based on a given location, radius, and type of place. It's like spinning a globe and going wherever your finger lands, but with a little more control over the general area and type of destination.

To run the notebook, you'll need a Google Maps API key. You can get one here. The notebook will guide you through the process of entering your location, radius, and type of place, and then it will display your random destination on a map.

How to Run
1. Navigate to Random_place_from_google_maps.ipynb file.
2. Open the README file for detailed instructions and insights.
3. Run in google colab or Jupyter notebook locally.
Stay tuned for more fun notebooks! We're always adding new ones, so check back often. If you have an idea for a notebook, please open an issue and let us know. We'd love to hear your suggestions.
